# CO2_cyano_CRISPRi

This repository collects the analysis for the *Synechocystis* sp. PCC 6803 CRISPRi library (compare [Miao et al., 2023](https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/35/11/3937/7231705?login=true)) when grown at 4% or 30% CO_2. For analysis, sequencing files were processed using the [nf-core-crispriscreen workflow](https://github.com/MPUSP/nf-core-crispriscreen).
